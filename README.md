# Translation
[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/atoum-documentation/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/atoum-documentation)

## Information for Translators

We use the Crowdin translation platform (see our [project on Crowdin ](https://crowdin.com/project/atoum-documentation)) and their [client](https://crowdin.com/page/cli-tool) to manage translations.

### Usage
In command line mode, sending source files is done with this command:

	crowdin-cli upload source

Downloading the existing translations is done with this command:

	crowdin-cli download

## Translating pages
You can directly edit any page (but don't forget to copy them on Crowdin after translating it) *or* you can use Crowdin's interface directly.

The second option is the easiest for most people.

## Adding new pages

1. Create the page in French (French is the reference language) or at least create an issue to ask someone to do it for you
1. This page must have a name related to its content and should be named in the language you are translating into
1. In the *source/LANGUAGE/index.rst* file, create a link to your new page
1. In the *crowdin.yaml* file, create the information related to this new page now ready for translation
1. Push the new page to Crowdin

## Adding a new language

1. Create the new directory under *source/LANGUAGE*, where *LANGUAGE* is the locale code for the new language you want to add (see [this page](https://crowdin.com/page/api/language-codes) for the list of supported languages and their locale code on Crowdin)
1. In the *crowdin.yaml* file add the new language for each translation (under *languages_mapping*)
1. Push your translation to Crowdin

## Building the documentation

### Usage

	php builddoc

Or you can also use

	./builddoc

### Requirements

* Having [sphinx installed](http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html)
* Having php cli available
* Having crowdin-cli installed

### Building using Docker

	SPHINXBUILD="docker run --rm -v $PWD:/doc umbrellium/sphinx-doc sphinx-build" ./builddoc html

## FAQ

### Why Crowdin?
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/atoum-documentation) helps seeing the progression of translations. It also has a good suggestion module created both from the already translated parts and from Bing Translator.

### Do we need to translate anchors?
An anchor in the documentation is displayed as such:

	.. _installation-par-composer:

They must not be translated and remain the same as in the original translation. It will be easier for other people to translate other page referencing this anchor. Translations anchors would result in broken links when you switch language on the site.

### Where can I find the syntax for the files?
We use the reStructuredText syntax. You can find it on the [sphinx website](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html).

### What are the title underline order?
In reStructuredText syntax, you can use a wide variety of character to underline. The order use in the atoum documentation is : #, *, =, -, ", ^, `, :, ., ' . Now if you have more than 4 subdivisions you may want to split your document into multiple files.
