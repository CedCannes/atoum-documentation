Integration of atoum in your IDE
################################

.. _ide_sublime2:

Sublime Text 2
**************

A `plug-in for SublimeText 2 <https://github.com/toin0u/Sublime-atoum>`_ allows the execution of unit tests by atoum and the visualization of the result without leaving the editor.

The information necessary for it's installation and it's configuration are available `on the blog's author <http://sbin.dk/2012/05/19/atoum-sublime-text-2-plugin/>`_.

.. _ide_vim:

VIM
***

atoum comes with a plug-in facilitates its use in VIM.

It allows to run tests without leaving VIM and obtaining the report in a separate window.

It's possible to navigate among errors, or even to go to the line in the editor with an assertion from failed test with a simple combination of keys.


Installation of the plug-in atoum for VIM
=========================================

You will find the file corresponding to the plug-in, named ``atoum.vmb``, in the directory named ``resources/vim``.

If you are using the PHAR archive, you must extract the file with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ php atoum.phar --extractResourcesTo path/to/a/directory

Once the extraction is performed, the file ``atoum.vmb`` corresponding to the plug-in for VIM will stand in the directory ``path/to/a/directory/resources/vim``.

Once in possession of the ``atoum.vmb`` file, it's required to edit with VIM:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ vim path/to/atoum.vmb

It's now required to ask VIM the installation of the plug-in by using the command:

.. code-block:: vim

   :source %


Use of the plug-in atoum for VIM
================================

To use the plug-in, atoum must obviously be installed and you must be editing a file containing a class of unit tests based on atoum.

Once in this configuration, the following command will launch the execution of tests:

.. code-block:: vim

   :Atoum

The tests are executed, and once they are finished, a report based on the configuration of atoum file located in the directory ``ftplugin/php/atoum.vim`` in your ``.vim`` directory is generated in a new window.

Of course, you are free to bind this command to the combination of keys of your choice, for example adding the following line in your ``.vimrc`` file:

.. code-block:: vim

   nnoremap *.php <F12> :Atoum<CR>

The use of the key ``F12`` on your keyboard in normal mode will call the command ``:Atoum``.


File's configuration management of atoum
========================================

You can specify another configuration file for atoum by adding the following line to your ``.vimrc`` file:

.. code-block:: vim

   call atoum#defineConfiguration('/path/to/project/directory', '/path/to/atoum/configuration/file', '.php')

Indeed the function ``atoum#defineConfiguration`` allow to defined the configuration file to use, based on the directory where the unit test files are located.
It take three arguments:

* a path to the directory containing the unit tests;
* a path to the configuration's file of atoum to be used;
* the extension's file of relevant unit test.

For more details on the use of plug-in, help is available in VIM with the following command:

.. code-block:: vim

   :help atoum

* :ref:`macvim<ide_auto-open_macvim>` (Mac OS X)
* :ref:`gvim<ide_auto-open_gvim>` (Unix)
* :ref:`PhpStorm<ide_auto-open_phpstorm>` (Mac OS X/Unix)
* :ref:`gedit<ide_auto-open_gedit>` (Unix)

To use this feature, you need to change the :ref:`configuration file <fichier-de-configuration>`:
