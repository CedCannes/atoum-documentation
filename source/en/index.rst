What is atoum?
====================

atoum is a unit test framework like PHPUnit or SimpleTest, but it has a few advantages over these:

* It's modern and uses the innovations of the latest PHP's version (>= 5.3);
* It is simple and easy to learn;
* It is intuitive, its syntax is to be as close to the English natural language;
* despite the constant changes of atoum, backward compatibility is one of the priorities of its developers.
