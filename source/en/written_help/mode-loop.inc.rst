The loop mode
****************

When a developer doing TDD (test-driven development), it usually works as following:

# He start writing test corresponding to what he wants to develop ;
# then runs the test created;
# then writes the code to pass the test;
# then amends or complete his test and go back to step 2.

In practice, this means that he must:

* create its code in his favourite editor;
* exit the editor and then run its test in a console;
* return to his editor to write the code that enables the test to pass ;
* return to the console to restart its test execution;
* return to his publisher in order to amend or supplement its test;

There is therefore a cycle that will be repeated as long as the functionality haven't been developed entirely.

We can notice that, during this cycle, the developer must seize recurrently the same command in the terminal to run the unit tests.

atoum offers the available ``loop`` mode  via the arguments ``-l`` or ``--loop``, which allows the developer to not restart manually the test and thus to streamline the development process.

In this mode, atoum begins run once the tests that are requested.

Once the tests are complete, if tests successfully pass, atoum simply wait:

.. code-block:: shell

If the developer press the ``Enter`` key, atoum will reexecute the same test again, without any other action from the developer.

In the case where the code doesn't pass the tests successfully, i.e. If assertions fails or if there were errors or exceptions, atoum also start waiting:

If the developer press the ``Enter`` key, instead of replay the same tests again like if the tests have been passed successfully, atoum will only execute the tests that have failed, rather than replay them all.

The developer can pops issues and replay error tests as many times as necessary simply by pressing ``Enter``.

Moreover, once all failed tests pass again successfully, atoum will automatically run all of the test suite to detect any regressions introduced by the corrections made by the developer.

Of course, the ``loop`` mode will take only :ref:`the files with unit tests launch <fichiers-a-executer>` by atoum.
